# Nextcloud is a suite of client-server software for creating file hosting services and using them. It is functionally similar to Dropbox, although Nextcloud is free and open-source, allowing anyone to install and operate it on a private server. In contrast to proprietary services, Nextcloud can be hosted on a private server, without additional cost.
